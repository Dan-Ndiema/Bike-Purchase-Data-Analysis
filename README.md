### Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to bike purchases. The main objectives were to clean and transform the data and visualize the findings through a dashboard. The analysis focuses on understanding the average income per gender, bike purchase patterns based on commute distance, and bike purchase trends across different age brackets.

### Data Source

For this project i used the Bike Sales Data.csv from Kaggle Data Sets.

### Tools

Excel - Data cleaning and Data visualizations

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

I perfomed the following tasks in cleaning and preparation of my data:
1.Filled out abbreviations in the marital status column (e.g., M to Married, S to Single).

2.Updated the gender column by changing F to Female and M to Male.

3.Updated the gender column by changing F to Female and M to Male.

4.Created a new column named "Age Bracket" to categorize ages into:

-Adolescents (0-30 years)

-Middle Age (31-55 years)

-Old (55+ years)

5.Generated a pivot table to calculate the average income per gender considering bike purchase status.

Created a pivot table to count bike purchases based on commute distance.

Developed a pivot table to count bike purchases across different age brackets (Adolescents, Middle Age, Old).

### Data Findings

1.Income Levels: Higher income levels are associated with a greater likelihood of purchasing bikes.

2.Commute Distance: Shorter commute distances encourage bike purchases.

3.Age Influence: Younger and middle-aged individuals are more inclined to purchase bikes compared to older individuals.

4.Gender Differences: There are noticeable differences in bike purchase behavior between genders.

5.Marital Status Impact: Marital status influences bike purchase decisions, with married individuals showing significant purchasing behavior.

### Recommendations

1.High-Income Segments: Focus marketing efforts on higher income individuals, as they are more likely to purchase bikes.

2.Comfort Features for Older Adults: Develop bikes with comfort and ease-of-use features specifically designed for older adults (55+ years) to encourage bike usage in this age group.

3.Discounts for Younger Buyers: Offer discounts or financing options for younger buyers to make bikes more accessible to this age group.
